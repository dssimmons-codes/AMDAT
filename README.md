# AMDAT â€” Amorphous Molecular Dynamics Analysis Toolkit

AMDAT is a C++ toolkit for post-processing molecular dynamics trajectories, with a focus on amorphous/glassy/polymer materials. It loads a trajectory into memory for very fast analysis. It reads LAMMPS formats and (optionally) GROMACS `.xtc`. It provides high-performance analyses, such as clustering, spatial decomposition, and calculating time-resolved structure factors, mean-square displacements, radial distribution functions, etc.

## Quick start (Linux, Conda)

### Build with conda environment (Recommended)
```bash
make conda-setup
conda activate amdat
make
```

## Run
```bash
./AMDAT -i path/to/input.in
```
