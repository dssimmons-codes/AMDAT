<h1>delete_multibody_list</h1>

Deletes an existing multibody\_list and frees the associated memory. Does not delete the underlying multibodies themselves - only a list referencing multibodies for analysis. Memory gains are therefore usually modest.

_delete\_multibody\_list \<name of multibody\_list to delete\>_
