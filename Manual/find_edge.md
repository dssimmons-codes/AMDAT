<h1>find_edge</h1>

At each time, reports the position of the first particle in the bin encountered along a specified vector. Syntax is as follows.

_find\_bin \<output filename\> \<x component of vector\> \<y component of vector\> \<z component of vector\>

Can in principle be run on a trajectory_list as well, but primarily intended for use with bin_lists.
