<h1>neighbor decorrelation function</h1>

Calculates an autocorrelation function for the mean number of initial neighbors that are still neighbors at a later displacement time. The syntax is as follows.

_neighbor\_decorrelation\_function \<name of data file to write\> \<name of neighborlist to analyze\>

This should be followed by a target line specifying a trajectory\_list. The analysis will be performed only for central particles specified in the trajectory\_list.
