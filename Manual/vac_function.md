<h1>vac_function</h1>

Calculates velocity autocorrelation function by taking two derivatives of the mean-square-displacement. This works only for trajectories that are linearly spaced in time (not for exponential timeschemes). It also requires that frames be closely spaced in time in order to give high quality results. _Note that this method presently does not employ velocity data directly!_
