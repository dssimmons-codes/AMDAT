<h1>isf_list</h1>

Calculate intermediate scattering function, using a trajectory list.

_isf\_list \<output file\> \<list name\> \<plane\> \<first wavenumber index\> \<last wavenumber index\>_

Options for _\<geometry\>_ are _xyz, xy, xz, yz, x, y,_ and _z_. This chooses which dimensions in k-space to include in the calculation of the intermediate scattering function. _xyz_ computes the full radial three dimensional isf, _xy, yz, and xz_ calculate two-dimensional in-plane radial isf's, and _x, y, and z_ compute one-dimensional isf's.
